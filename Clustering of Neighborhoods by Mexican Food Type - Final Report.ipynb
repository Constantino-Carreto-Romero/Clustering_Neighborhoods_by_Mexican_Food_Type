    "Let's say we are in the food bussiness, especifically, the mexican street food (e.g. tacos, tortas, pizza, etc.) and we want to start new branches in Mexico City. How can we decide where to place our new branches? We would like to avoid high competition, but at the same time we want to be in places with great demand for our type of food. If for instance we want to sell tacos, what locations in the city might be the best to place our branches?\n",

    "To try to answer these questions, I cluster neighborhoods in Mexico City according to the presence of a couple of mexican food types: quesadillas, tacos, pizza, tortas, and hamburgers. To collect this data I use the Foursquare API. Then, I implement k-means clustering to group neighborhoods into clusters that help to identify neighborhoods where a type of food is prefered. This will indicate where there is high competition in certain food types and where there is high demand for that food type."
