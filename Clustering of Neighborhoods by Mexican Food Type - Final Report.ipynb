How can we decide where to place our new branches? We would like to avoid high competition, but at the same time, we want to be in places with great demand for our type of food. If for instance, we want to sell tacos, what locations in the city might be the best to place our branches?\n",

This will indicate where there is high competition in certain food types and where there is a high demand for that food type."

Nonetheless, we must be cautious with some limitations. As mentioned before, to find that a certain type of food is predominant in a neighborhood and that there are a lot of businesses that sell that food type, also implies that there is high competition in that economic market in that neighborhood. In other words, if for instance in a neighborhood is preferred pizza over the rest of the food types, it is suggestive but not indicative that we should place our new business in that neighborhood. Competition might be really high in that market that the entrance might no be feasible.
